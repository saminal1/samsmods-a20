## Sam's Deco Stuff
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SDecoStuff

Adds some extra recipes for variant blocks to allow several non-functional blocks to be placed. Some are already available to craft elsewhere but included in these variants as part of a theme.

## Sam's Storage Stuff
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SStorageStuff

Adds recipes and custom blocks for large, lockable storage containers; fridges, pill cases, bookcases and a desk, all with the storage space of a full crate (8 x 9).

## Sam's Building Stuff
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SBuildingStuff

Adds Wood Bars back in to be upgraded to Iron (not to Cobblestone and Concrete as via the shape menu). Adds Steel Bars as an upgrade from Iron Bars. Adds Steel Spike Traps to upgrade Iron Spike Traps. Adds recipes for some POI doors and windows otherwise not craftable.

## Sam's Working Stuff
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SWorkingStuff

Adds working faucets, an oven, and working versions of POI lights (which require power). Also included a Wireless Wire Relay (huge thanks to PhDGaming for the trick to make this work) to make wiring tidier, especially since a couple of the POI lights have wire connection points in the wrong place.

## Sam's Special Ammo
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SSpecialAmmo

Adds Shock Arrows, Shock Bolts, Concussion Grenades, Shock Grenades, and a Heavy Snowball. Recipes are gated behind appropriate skills, but the items will show up in random loot and quest rewards.

Careful with the snowball, you'll have someone's eye out with that.

## Sam's Sustainable Forestry
Download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/saminal1/samsmods-a20/tree/main/SSustainableForestry

Almost completely removes seeds from the game; there is a small chance to drop a modified seed which will grow into a random tree, rather than always to the same exact shape. Reduces the visual and performance impacts of players building dense tree farms at their bases.

Comments in the blocks.xml file should allow users to modify seed drop chance (or disable it completely) and regrowth time - default 1 hour.
